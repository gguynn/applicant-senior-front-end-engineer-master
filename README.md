[MERGED PULL REQUEST 3](https://github.com/gguynn/applicant-senior-front-end-engineer-master/pull/3)

### Aug 7, 9a-12p

#### Theme Development: Breakpoints and Testing

- Added media queries for larger screens.
- * Note: while responsive breakpoints came last, larger screens were reviewed ahead of time and mobile-first was built accordningly. There were no "gotchas" in this example. Adding styles for larger screens was strait-forward.
- Published to staging @ [http://garrettg3.sg-host.com/](http://garrettg3.sg-host.com/)
- Tested site on different OSs, browsers and devicess with various screen sizes.

[MERGED PULL REQUEST 4](https://github.com/gguynn/applicant-senior-front-end-engineer-master/pull/4)

### Aug 9, 12p-2p

#### Theme Development: JavaScript and Testing

Initially, I authored javascript in the most-straitgorward way possible using jQuery to maximize readability. This allowed for flexibility while still making decisions with markup, styles, and animations in the theme. After being satisfied with the theme's overall functionality and having committed to structure, I spent time optimizing my initial javascript by pulling from a module-based approach to get to the finish line.

- [navigation.js before modules](https://github.com/gguynn/applicant-senior-front-end-engineer-master/blob/f19faecdfdf5a7fb958a8b0cfaa0c338bfbd012d/src/theme/sfee/assets/js/frontend/navigation.js) (Draft).
- [navigation.js after modules](https://github.com/gguynn/applicant-senior-front-end-engineer-master/blob/master/src/theme/sfee/assets/js/frontend/navigation.js) (Optimal)
- * Note transpiling was not used for this exercise and is recommended in most real-world production environments.

# Project

## 10up Senior Front End Engineering Technical Challenge

Your task is to create the attached design within a WordPress theme environment. The theme should use a WordPress menu for the main navigation, a standard loop output for displaying the article under the navigation, and the WP search. All the necessary design files are inside this directory as well as any information you need to complete the exercise.

The designs are given for large screen (1200px) and small screen (360px), you should adjust the UI as you see fit to accommodate your chosen breakpoints - it is OK to deviate from the design for this purpose as long as the largest and smallest breakpoints match the design.

Please use your best judgement for any decisions that need to be made about the implementation including potential task runners, modules, plugins, and libraries you feel are necessary to create the interface. The goal of this exercise is to help us gauge your knowledge with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so be sure you display anything you want us to see!

Please also track your time, our goal is to make these exercises thorough, but not overwhelming so getting your feedback very much helps the process.

### ATTN: Please do not use a starter theme to complete this exercise.

We are testing certain aspects of front-end implementations that are often invalidated or incorrect with some popular WordPress starter themes. To get a true submission, please build from as near scratch as you can.
